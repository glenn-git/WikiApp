ArrayArrayLinear›Indexed collection of elements (values or variables) of the same type stored at linear (or contiguous) memory locations due to its similar nature together.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearÂHierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children. It maintains a sorted order through insertion of nodes, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.GraphGraph
Non-Linear¢Data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It models relationships between objects and can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic.
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearÊUnordered collection of unique (key, value) pairs in a data structure that provides efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations. It uses hash function to compute an index into an array.HeapTree
Non-LinearÆA binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is often used to implement priority queues and provides efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority.Linked listListLinearÜSequential access of nodes that contain two fields: data and a link to next node. Linear collection order is not given by their physical placement in memory, but each element points to the next. It supports dynamic size.ListListLinearIndexed collection of abstract elements with linear order that allow duplicates and can be implemented as arrays or linked lists.QueueAbstractLinearáCollection of abstract elements that follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It allows elements to be enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front, making it suitable for tasks like managing tasks in a printer queue.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearøBinary search tree that automatically balances itself during insertion and deletion to ensure relatively uniform tree height, preventing performance degradation. A node can have more than two children. Other examples are AVL tree or Red-Black tree.SetAbstract
Non-LinearÂUnordered collection of distinct elements with no duplicates. It provides operations for adding, removing, and checking the existence of elements, making it useful for maintaining unique values.StackAbstractLinearÇLinear data structure that follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It allows elements to be pushed and popped from the top, making it ideal for managing function calls and tracking program state.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinear—Indexed collection of elements (values or variables) of the same type arranged in a grid-like 2-D matrices that use additional subscripts for indexing.SaveAsdfAsdfDasfTestTesTtestTest
